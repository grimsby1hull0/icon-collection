How To make Use of the Icons:
1. You need system 7 or higher.
2. Do a "Get Info" (File menu) on the original MacTown icon file that you want to use.
3. Click on the icon in the window; choose "Copy" (Edit menu).
4. Close the window, then "Get Info" on destination file/disk.
5. Click on the icon, choose "Paste" (Edit menu).
6. Don't forget to e-mail me and let me know what you think!

Register and Contact:
Well, there's really no registration necessary to use this set. But, I would appreciate if you let me know what you think of it! Send a postcard or something, okay? Better yet, send me your own MacTown icons! If I like 'em, I may include them in a future release of MacTown icons sets (credited to you, of course!). Also, if you get on my mailing list, I'll notify you of any updates or Icon sets! Kay? Kay!
