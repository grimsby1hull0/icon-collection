The Beatles: Yellow Submarine
Premiered 1968

Once upon a time...or maybe twice, there was anunearthly paradise called Pepperland - a place where happiness and music reignedsupreme. But all that was threatened when the terrible Blue Meanies declared war and sent in their army led by a menacing Flying Glove todestroy all that was good. Enter John, Paul, George and Ringo to save the day! Armed with little more than their humor, songs, and of course, their yellow submarine, the Fab Four tackle the rough seas ahead in an effort to bring down the evil forces of bluedom.
