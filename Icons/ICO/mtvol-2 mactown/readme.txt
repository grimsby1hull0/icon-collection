Welcome to MacTown, U.S.A.!

Introduction:
When I first introduced MacTown to the public a couple months ago, I promised an Icon a Day to expand your MacTown collection! And here I am, making good on that promise with the first release of MacTown Supplemental Icons (also know as MacTown, Vol. 2)! There are a number of icon sets that work together, along with the desktop pattern and a Kaleidoscope Color Scheme, to create the wondrous Majesty that is MacTown! I hope you enjoy Volume Two of the MacTown Icons, and I encourage you to create your own and send them to me! If I like them, I may include them in a future release!

How To make Use of the Icons:
1. You need system 7 or higher.
2. Do a "Get Info" (File menu) on the original MacTown icon file that you want to use.
3. Click on the icon in the window; choose "Copy" (Edit menu).
4. Close the window, then "Get Info" on destination file/disk.
5. Click on the icon, choose "Paste" (Edit menu).
6. Don't forget to e-mail me and let me know what you think!

Register and Contact:
Well, there's really no registration necessary to use this set. But, I would appreciate if you let me know what you think of it! Send a postcard or something, okay? Better yet, send me your own MacTown icons! If I like 'em, I may include them in a future release of MacTown icons sets (credited to you, of course!). Also, if you get on my mailing list, I'll notify you of any updates or Icon sets! Kay? Kay!
