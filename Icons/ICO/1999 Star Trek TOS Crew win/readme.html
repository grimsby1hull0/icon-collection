	<h3>From the Artist</h3>
		<p class="date">October 1, 1999</p>

			<em>Star Trek: The Original Series   Volume 1: The Crew</em>
			by <a href="mailto:dave@iconfactory.com">Dave Brasgalla</a>
 
		</p>
		<p>Like a lot of people, I grew up watching Star Trek. I was three years old when it went on the air, and I remember actually seeing some of the original broadcasts. The show has been extremely influential, both in my childhood and all through my career as an artist. The color sense, the design, the lighting &#8211; you can see the mark Star Trek has left all through my work.</p>


	<p>I started making icons after being inspired by how wonderful Corey&#8217;s Star Trek Objects icons were, back in the early days of the Iconfactory (long before I joined). I knew I had to learn how to do what Corey had done!</p>


	<p>I have always wanted to make these icons, but I did not feel I was &#8220;ready&#8221; until I did the Labyrinth icon set. After Labyrinth, I knew I would be able to make these look the way I envisioned them.</p>


	<p>I am one of those people who feels The Original Series is still the best. Kirk, Spock, McCoy &#8211; that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about to me (although I often enjoy Voyager). I feel the lack of money forced them to be super-creative, and everyone worked incredibly hard to make the show what is was. I think that&#8217;s why it endures.</p>


	<p>These icons are intended as my tribute to the show, and I have tried to imbue them with as much of the visual feel of the show as I am able.</p>


	<p>I hope these icons eventually become considered a Star Trek classic as well&#8230;  : )</p>


	<p>Enjoy!</p>


	<p>These icons are dedicated to Jackson DeForest Kelley, who passed on this year.  &#8221;...deep space is my dwelling place, the stars my destination&#8230;&#8221;</p>
